Hello to everyone! My name is Natalya
I'm enjoyed to participate in this course. 

1. Git Basics
It was quite useful stage for me. Some information I have known before, because I have completed course as a Markup Developer last year. As for me I knew only how to create the repo, init git in the project, make commit, add files, and push, I beleived that it would be enough for my future work. But in this basic lectures on Coursera and after completing the tasks from learngitbranching.js.org, I have known more complicated commands, that I could use further.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP 
2. Linux CLI and Networking
All knowledge in this stage was new for me, because in my daily work I am dealing onl with Windows. As for me this was very useful information, so I did some notes not to forget everything I have known. HTTP protocol part 1, I knew some information, status code, response and request, headers, body, and some was new for me as format requests.
The screenshots of Linux completed task.

## Git Collaboration
This stage was very complicative for me, I needed to reread one topic more then one times to understand. There are lot of tricks that facilitate the work with github, that I think I wil use in my future work.
